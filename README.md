# Forecast-of-Carbon-Monoxide
Time Series Analysis Project - Forecast the Carbon Monoxide Level of outdoor air
The goal of this project is to forecast the carbon monoxide level of outdoor air. Carbon monoxide (CO) is known as a silent death because it can cause a sudden death. CO is a colorless, odorless gas, so there is no way to know if there is too much CO gas in the air. Forecasting the CO level will help everyone be prepared and take precautions as necessary. 
The dataset is Air Quality of an Italian city, obtained from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/nishantbhadauria/datasetucimlairquality. The data is collected hourly.
